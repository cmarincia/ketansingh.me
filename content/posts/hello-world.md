This blog is supposed to be a place where I hope to put forward thoughts and tricks of the trade I come across during my daily hustle. It is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and is using [ezhil](https://github.com/vividvilla/ezhil) theme. Originally I started with [hugo-ink](https://github.com/knadh/hugo-ink) theme which is a fork of ezhil and is supposed to be better but as soon as I started working with it, I noticed that explicit dark mode doesn't works as intended. Perhaps I might try to fix it in near future but for now ezhil will do. With that out of the way, CI/CD was configured with [Netlify](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/) which was very easy to integrate and voila we have a blog setup within an hour.
